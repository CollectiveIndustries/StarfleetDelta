[20:57] SCAI-FIRE: Simulated Combat Artifical Intellegent Fully Imsersive Roleplay Environment is now loading.....
[20:58] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Oh wow
[20:58] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): like i Said Fully Interactive
[20:58] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): it gets better
[20:58] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): And is that a hit?
[20:59] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): the ship shaking is us taking damage
[20:59] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): yeah
[20:59] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): as you could see the view screen also displaed tractor beams and wepons exchange
[21:00] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so none of your typical "i shot five torpedoes 2 landed" other offiver "all 5 hit the target"
[21:00] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): right
[21:00] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): those are the discrepancies that i hate in RP
[21:01] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): every one wants to lead but no one wants to do there own part
[21:01] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): BUt who decides what happens?
[21:01] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): this takes the guess work out
[21:01] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): the Host
[21:01] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): in combination with the AI
[21:02] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so for instance as the RP host or hostess you would instruct the AI to set certain values
[21:02] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): OH okay
[21:02] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): taking thos into concideration the computer would relay information to status reports dialogs view screen display
[21:02] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): comm messages
[21:02] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): or console print outs
[21:03] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): at that point the RP'er (Interactive part of FIRE) would then make a choice to read the information and relay it to the Capttain
[21:03] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so example
[21:03] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Sounds like it would be good for people like me who have no clue what to do next
[21:05] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): durring our little adventure with the Enterprise we took damage a status report would come up on my screen (Engineering) Captain " statusreport all stations" Engineering "Hull damage on deck 3 7 8 14 structuarl integratiry down to 97% sheilds stable at 67%"
[21:05] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): bam all the information is acurattly tracked and displayed
[21:05] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Nice
[21:06] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): hand held creww tools would then need to interact with consoles in order to fix the ship and the change the status report
[21:06] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): but wait theres more
[21:06] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): ok
[21:06] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): lets say we took damage and our internal sensors failed
[21:06] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): Security would loose all inforation on there console
[21:07] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): also as a side effect Medical/science would register ZERO life signs on the internal ship sensors
[21:07] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): ok
[21:07] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): essentially the host/hostess would point the ship in a direction
[21:08] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): let the crew figure it out
[21:08] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): weather they sink or swim that bridge crew is all you got
[21:08] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): also as another example
[21:09] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): lets say as an intruder i manage to eject the warp core
[21:09] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): engineering is offline
[21:09] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): power is down
[21:09] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): engines are down
[21:09] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): system is at Grey Alert
[21:09] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Grey alert?
[21:10] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): No power
[21:10] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Ah ok
[21:10] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): When in gray mode, the starship ran on reserve power, cutting power to non-essential decks and ship systems
[21:10] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): essentially were off the grid
[21:10] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): ok
[21:11] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): now none of that can be fixed unless certain parameters or fullfilled
[21:11] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): namely a shuttle with a tractor beam
[21:11] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): grab the core put it back engineering crew reinstalls it
[21:11] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): reboot the ship and off you go
[21:12] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): all of this would effect the Lights, power, doors, forcefields, etx
[21:12] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): lack of shields and life support and weponsd
[21:12] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Sounds great
[21:12] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so now take that into account
[21:13] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): more of the I in fire life support is failing batteries on reserve you either fix the ship by the time the clock hits Zero or the crew is "wiped"
[21:13] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): meaning the crew dies and the ship is lost in space
[21:14] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): think of it this way
[21:14] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): you know those old Choose your own Story books?
[21:14] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): yeah
[21:14] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): this is a Choose your own RP ship
[21:15] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): cool
[21:15] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): except as a crew you have to make a choice with the CoC activly involved in the RP
[21:15] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): every concole will have its own functionality and only those functions can be used on those consoles
[21:16] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): for instance Medical cant fire phasers
[21:16] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): and the Tactical cant run the Engines
[21:16] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): right
[21:17] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so it keeps people in line by inforcing RP rules and at the same time Extends the RP to a Fully Interactive RP Event
[21:17] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): I think it's great
[21:17] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): It takes the guesswork out
[21:18] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): And enables people like me to not look like an idiot
[21:18] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): and all of that is because of the way SCAI net is designed. the host/hostess  would have an RP hud to instruct the AI of the major turning points at that point the AI Simulates Combat and lets the crew deal with the results
[21:18] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): The few times I couldn't rp medical I was lost
[21:19] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): now i can do the programming
[21:19] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): but we will need to get a few puzzle peices worked out to get a better end result
[21:19] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): and because its DB driven
[21:19] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): the entire system
[21:20] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): can be tweaked and changed and designed with any scenario you want from scratch
[21:20] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Before you spend a lot of time on it, I want the Captain's to see it and agree to it
[21:20] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): They are the ones that do the RP's
[21:20] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): well like i said it here and it stays
[21:20] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): i want a full look at from everyone
[21:20] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): So, Falcon, Charlie, Kinney and Lili
[21:20] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): okay
[21:21] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): i want every ones opinion even if its N/A i want a name :)
[21:21] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): mmhmm
[21:21] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): cause this is SL RP version 2.0
[21:21] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Well, you sold me
[21:22] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): you have seen what Kodos and Evo nd i did with the Academics so im sure you can imagine exaactly what this baby can do
[21:22] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Yes
[21:24] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): did you get a chance to see the EPS and console?

[21:25] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): I saw the EPS not the console
[21:25] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): once this all goes live
[21:26] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): if the targeting computer on the alien ship targets subsystems each console will take there own damage
[21:26] CHIPPIE JEAN AMETZA (chippewagal47 Resident) is offline.
[21:26] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): explosions will happen

[21:26] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): OH look at that
[21:27] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so that little interactive part of the ship just did this in english "We took damage the ship rolled and the console exploded" or we can scrap the line from RP and just do it

[21:27] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): I's say just do it
[21:27] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): and that was what i was looking at
[21:27] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): *I'd
[21:28] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): World of warcraft is Dungeons and Dragons in 3d
[21:28] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): SL up until now has only had Text based RP
[21:28] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): on a staged set
[21:28] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): right
[21:28] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): ergo DND and there primitive table top paper waisting game
[21:28] emDash HUD: Kent (kinney.bellic) has entered chat range.
[21:29] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): this is the 3D Role Play ive always wanted

[21:30] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): the best part you probably noticed is that little 3D map like structure in the center of the floor
[21:30] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): my own personal Astrometrics holo graphic display system

[21:31] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): it litterally plots out the universe around you in the virtual world displays icons to designate sectors in space
[21:31] SCAI-FIRE: Configuration could not be read on line 43
[21:31] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): each sector is completly diffrent
[21:32] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so there you have every Bridge station and viewscreen console and an Astrometrics lab
[21:32] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): also i have in the works a micro holo comm system but im in the middle of that one
[21:33] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so lets say we run up against an Intrepid class ship
[21:33] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): A) we get it on screen
[21:33] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): B) we get a 3D modle of it in world
[21:33] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): this is Second life go big or go home
[21:33] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Awesome
[21:34] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): and honestly we need something to keep people coming to our home
[21:34] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so i say Go Big and drive it home to the other ST RP Groups
[21:34] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): And this could certainly do ti
[21:34] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): it
[21:34] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): i know it can
[21:35] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): James wants SCAI-FIRE i wont budge
[21:35] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): I say screw the other groups, we could take over the world
[21:35] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): every other group ive showed this too wanted to hire me out right
[21:35] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): on the spot
[21:35] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): but i never had the time untill now
[21:36] Kent (kinney Bellic): bk
[21:36] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): and because ive always felt at home with this group be it UFGQ or SDQ these people in this group that have stayed this long or the reason i stay

[21:37] Kent (kinney Bellic): and mine
[21:37] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): Kenny have you had a chance to look this place over?

[21:38] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): Your welcome
[21:39] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): i can build you a Lamborghini but honestly if no one comes around use it or even be a part of it it might as well be Huffy
[21:39] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): right
[21:39] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): so this is what i can do but we still need PR work and im not one for Public Pressance
[21:40] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): Be Right Back
[21:41] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): And that we can handle
[21:41] Kent (kinney Bellic): indeed
[21:42] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): Can you make a small portable model to demo at the next SL SciFi Con?
[21:42] Kent (kinney Bellic): if fire involves audio i dont have a new audio card yet
[21:43] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): ATM it does not
[21:43] Kent (kinney Bellic): ok
[21:43] Kent (kinney Bellic): i clicked the click me box lol
[21:44] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): And reset
[21:44] Kent (kinney Bellic): clicked that as well
[21:44] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): then watch the screen and the console and the green tubes
[21:44] Kent (kinney Bellic): ok
[21:45] Kent (kinney Bellic): is there a command or something i must do?
[21:45] Lucine Dax (pnthrpink1 Resident): ummm
[21:46] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): now one part of SCAI net we didnt talk about is the NETWORK part
[21:46] Kent (kinney Bellic): nice
[21:46] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): you take all of this ship design and crew and network it together
[21:47] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): meaning
[21:47] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): multiple ships multiple crews
[21:47] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): and even multiple sims
[21:47] Captain Sorex (AdmiralMorketh Sorex): all working together in a fleet
