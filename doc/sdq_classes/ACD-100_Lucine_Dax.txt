My name is <INSTRUCTOR_NAME> and I will be your instructor for today's class.

This is the  Delta Quadrant class.  

Please hold all questions until the end of the lecture, at which time, I will be glad to answer any that you may have.  

There will be an exam at the conclusion of the lecture.  

You may use your class notes, but please refrain for any talking during the exam.  

If you have any questions at that time, please IM the instructor.  

*Takes a deep breath and proceeds*

The primary goal of this class is to explain what you need to know about the inner workings of the Starfleet Delta Quadrant.

SDQ) so that you can function as a contributing member of our group.  

<IMAGE 9bb60266-5d91-deee-e484-2d9f5c3b3fae>

SDQ was founded and set up by Lucine Dax, Falcon Taurus, Data Spectre, Charlie Duffield, Evo Torrance, Kodos Macarthur and Morketh Sorex.

All, at one point or another, were active members of other Star Trek groups here in SL who decided to venture out on our own and form SDQ.  

SDQ is made up of a group of people with a similar vision that was Roddenberry's dream...  

We strive to keep the dream alive, live it to the fullest and share it with the world.  

We are, in essence, a group that shares the passion of Star Trek,

and to share that passion we meet in different metaverse locations such as Second Life and Open Life to live out Gene Roddenberry's dream.   
~
This group utilizes the technology and resources from the Star Trek universe in the 28th century, specifically the year 2417.


To that end, we see ourselves as the Federation presence in the Delta Quadrant - exploring new worlds and making new friends.  
  
~
*Smiles with pride, making eye contact with each person in the room*
~
SDQ is not only Starfleet, but also the Federation. 

We welcome all civilians into the Federation and offer many jobs that work in coordination with Starfleet. 

Event Productions - SFO, Startfleet Criminal Investigative Service - SCIS are just a few examples.

As we grow, we will look forward to new ideas for expanding our civilian roles within SDQ.

~
SDQ: Starfleet has a chain of command that starts with Cadets reporting to their Cadet Division Commanding Officers (CO).  

The Officers report to their Division heads and the Division heads report to the Admiral.  

The Admiral reports to United Federation Gamma Quadrant Committee. 
~

The group is as much yours as it is ours.  You help shape and steer the direction of the group.  

Every member has a voice no matter what level you are.  Your voice and opinions are important to us.  
~
~
The first step in starting your journey with SDQ is choosing if you want to join the civilian populous or join SDQ: Starfleet.       

Both positions (civilian and Starfleet) are valuable to the success and happiness of our group.

SDQ: Starfleet Option

Your first step towards becoming a Starfleet Officer is to take classes and graduate from our Academy.

A list of required classes will be made available to you through your instructors.

You have 2 paths you may choose to become an officer.

Path 1 is the Junior Officer program:  Is once you have completed your time at the basic (4 week) Academy and have graduated, you will become a commissioned officer with the rank of Ensign.

Path 2 is the Senior Officer program where you will complete the basic Academy and become a Graduate Student with the rank of Acting Ensign.

Then you will complete an additional (6 weeks) of classes and training, at the conclusion of this you will have a graduate degree and achieve rank of a full Lieutenant .

We have a variety of divisions including, but not limited to: Operations, Medical, Science, Communications, JAG, Diplomatic Corps, Engineering, etc. 

Once you have chosen your division, then you have another decision to make.  You will have to decide if you wish to join a ship or be a part of Headquarters.

Even if you are part of Headquarters, you will still be able to take part on a ship RP.  
~ 
SDQ is run on a 24-hour clock, using SLT/PST as our standard local time.  

Stardates are laid out as follows. Y= Year M= Month D= Day 

Dates should be written: YYMMDD.

For example: February 7, 2011, would like written like this: 110207
~
SDQ Divisions:
Our division colors are out of the norm, which we feel is an advantage that 
will separate SDQ from other Star Trek groups.  

We take great pride in that.  

We feel that in order to grow and prosper you need to think outside of the box.
~
Our Divisions are as follows:  
Command: Red
Engineering: Yellow
Diplomatic Corps: Beige
Science: Teal
Medical: Blue
Operations: Black
Academy: Violet
Judge Advocate General: White
Communications: Orange
Security: Grey
Temporal Investications: Dark Blue
Internet Technologies: Goldenrod
~
Officers should wear the color of the uniform that is coordinated with your division and rank in the group.  

For example if you are a Lieutenant in Communications, you will wear the orange officer’s uniform with the two gold rank pips on your right shoulder.  

You are also required to wear a tilter that will help identify your Rank and Division.  Your tilter should be the color of your Division. Then you will list your rank and department.  

For example: If you were an Ensign in Medical and part of Emergency Medicine, your tilter would be blue and read: Ensign | Emergency Medicine.
You will also wear the correct Group Tag for your Division.

~

By now, you should have picked up your uniform on the supply deck. Freshmen cadets wear green uniforms.  


You will be required to wear your green cadet uniform and equipment at all times while on the sim. 

For ceremonies and formal occasions such as weddings, promotion ceremonies and graduation ceremonies, you will be required to wear a Dress Uniform. 


We will always let you know beforehand which type of uniform to wear.  

All Academy cadets and Starfleet officers MUST be in correct uniform while on sim.  

In your sophomore year, you will decide which division you are interested in and will wear the corresponding cadet uniform color.

~

The Academy Commandant and the CO of the division you will be joining job is to be a support network for you and to assist you with your progress through the Academy until graduation.


The time that you spend as a cadet with SDQ Starfleet Academy’s Basic program will be split into 4 Semesters.  
Each Semester will last a minimum of approximately one real week (seven days).  

It is possible that it can take longer to go through the Academy, depending on your available time to take part in your minimum required classes, labs and activities.   

The SDQ: SF Academy Curriculum is set up into four semesters and is set out as follows:
~
FIRST SEMESTER - FRESHMAN CADET

When your TiG is  up your service record will be reviewed by your division CO and then submitted to the admiralty to be further reviewed and only on their approval will you advance in rank.
  
It is also a requirement for all officers to check in on the Monthly Roll Call found in the forums.

Civilians at SDQ:

As a civilian you can RP with our group: We have few requirements for civilians at SDQ.

Respect the officers an other civilian members.

Civilians are free to take most of the academy classes.  (Log the classes you take on a Weekly Report  to keep track of them, but it is not necessary to turn it in)

Civilian members normally do not participate in  the bridge RP’s, you might as a guest on board or in a specific role for that RP (guest villain)

You can RP as your character or in a variety of rolls, you can work with the Civilian Director and other things you can do.

Or you can  complete the academies first year courses and then you can be classified as a ships Civilian Crewman and then you can participate in bridge RP’s in that role.

If you later decide to become an officer you will get credit for the classes you have taken.

This concludes our lecture for today.
