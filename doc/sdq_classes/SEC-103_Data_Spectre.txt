Borg
The Borg are a force unmatched in the Galaxy.
The race is comprised of 'Drones', all of whom belonged to different species but were assimilated into the Borg Collective after their ship or planet were attacked.

A feature of Borg Drones making them extra formidable are their adaptable shielding, allowing them to become invulnerable to enemy weaponry.

and were originally traveling to a new star system in order to start a new colony.
Although initial first contact with the Etherians led to conflict, they have become allies with Voyager within The Forge.

Attrexians
Warp capable with planets spanning several star systems both side of the Romulan Neutral Zone,
the Attrexians are a mining race who remain neutral with all major empires in order to secure trading agreements, trading their minerals for new technology.
These types of trade agreements have left the Attrexian Society based on a mix-match of technology, not all of which is understood by Attrexian engineers.

Idryll
All that remains of an ancient star empire, the Idryll have been incorporated as a labour class on Attrexian worlds, ranging from scientific minds to formidable warriors.
Although most Idryll are happy with their role in Attrexian society.
Some believe that myths of their age old superiority means that Attraxion worlds are rightfully theres, and have set out to ancient ruins to find proof.
<TEXTURE:3e0a0d9c-4c80-7d2a-e87e-cf7d8a25967a>
Exomorphs
Appearing almost out of nowhere, the Exomorphs began an overwhelming attack on ships, stations and planets in Attrexian space.
All communication attempts have failed and there seems to be no end to their slaughter.
With variations of these aliens being from small lurkers to large commanders,
the Exomorphs sport claws and some even have the ability to spit venom, making them a dangerous opponent at short range.
This concludes our lecture for today.
