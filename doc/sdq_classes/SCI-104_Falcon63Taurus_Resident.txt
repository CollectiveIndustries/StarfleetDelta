Welcome to the Medical/Science Division in SDQ!
Our class today is MSI-205 / Planetary Classification
*Takes a deep breath and proceeds*
A planet is a celestial body in orbit around a star or stellar remnants that has sufficient mass for self-gravity and is nearly spherical in shape.
A planet must not share its orbital region with other bodies of significant size
(except for its own satellites),
and must be below the threshold for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.
If a celestial body meets those requirements, it is considered a planet; at that point,
the planet is further classified by its atmosphere and surface conditions into one of twenty-two known categories.
Classifications of Planets:
<TEXTURE:5be516c1-d5c2-16e9-d7cc-96212b2a2dd3>
CLASS A - Geothermal
AGE - 0-2 billion years
DIAMETER - 1,000-10,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere/Cold zone
SURFACE - Partially molten
ATMOSPHERE - Primarily hydrogen compounds
EVOLUTION - Cools to become class C
LIFE FORMS - None
EXAMPLE - Gothos
Class A planets are very small, barren worlds rife with volcanic activity.
This activity traps carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and keeps temperatures on Class A planets very hot, no matter the location in a star system.
When the volcanic activity ceases, the planet "dies" and is then considered a Class C planet.
<TEXTURE:e8fb2387-57a0-3461-007b-25d7ef5b7c75>
CLASS B - Geomorteus
AGE - 0-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 1,000-10,000 km
LOCATION - Hot zone
SURFACE - Partially molten, high surface temperature
ATMOSPHERE - Extremely tenuous, few chemically active gases
LIFE FORMS - None
EXAMPLE - Mercury
Class B planets are generally small worlds located within a star system's Hot Zone.
Highly unsuited for humanoid life, Class B planets have thin atmospheres composed primarily
of helium and sodium.
The surface is molten and highly unstable; temperatures range from 450° in the daylight, to nearly -200° at night.
No life forms have ever been observed on Class B planetoids.
<TEXTURE:4c61543a-db17-11a2-cfad-abbc4081f58b>
CLASS C - Geoinactive
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 1,000-10,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere/Cold zone
SURFACE - Low surface temperature
ATMOSPHERE - Frozen
LIFE FORMS - None
EXAMPLES - Pluto, Psi 2000
When all volcanic activity on a Class A planet ceases, it is considered Class C.
Essentially dead, these small worlds have cold, barren surfaces and possess no geological activity.
<TEXTURE:830b1ae9-95d0-4784-2707-4db59402fba0>
CLASS D - Planetoid
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 100-1,000 km
LOCATION - Hot zone/Ecosphere/Cold zone; found primarily in orbit of larger planets or in asteroid fields
SURFACE - Barren and cratered
ATMOSPHERE - None or very tenuous
LIFE FORMS - None
EXAMPLES - Moon (Sol IIIa), Lunar V (Bajor VIIe)
These are rocky or icy objects, also known as asteroids or comets respectively, which didn’t grow large enough to form planets.
Many moons are considered Class D, as are larger objects that often lie in the outer reaches of a star system, known as the Kuiper Belt.
Most are not suitable for humanoid life, though many can be colonized via pressure domes.
<TEXTURE:f4a8a622-4bdb-e25d-badc-32f1958c6b84>
CLASS E - Geoplastic
AGE - 0-2 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - Molten, high surface temperature
ATMOSPHERE - Hydrogen compounds and reactive gases
EVOLUTION - Cools to become class F
LIFE FORMS - Carbon-cycle (Excalbian)
EXAMPLE - Excalbia
Class E planets represent the earliest stage in the evolution of a habitable planet.
The core and crust is completely molten, making the planets susceptible to solar winds and
radiation and subject to extremely high surface temperatures.
The atmosphere is very thin, composed of hydrogen and helium.
As the surface cools, the core and crust begin to harden, and the planet evolves into a Class F world.
<TEXTURE:60c12df9-3540-51b9-3b1c-3c00ae184b2a>
CLASS F - Geometallic
AGE - 1-3 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - Volcanic eruptions due to molten core
ATMOSPHERE - Hydrogen compounds
EVOLUTION - Cools to become a class G
LIFE FORMS - Silicon-based (Horta)
EXAMPLE - Janus IV
A Class E planet makes the transition to Class F once the crust and core have begun to harden.
Volcanic activity is also commonplace on Class F worlds; the steam expelled from volcanic eruptions eventually condenses into water,
giving rise to shallow seas in which simple bacteria thrive.
When the planet's core is sufficiently cool, the volcanic activity ceases and the planet is considered Class G world.
<TEXTURE:b805fff2-dcac-61e6-3d5c-d2df8b0117c3>
CLASS G - Geocrystalline
AGE - 3-4 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - Still crystallizing
ATMOSPHERE - Carbon dioxide, some toxic gases
EVOLUTION - Cools to become class K, L, M, N, O or P
LIFE FORMS - Primitive single-celled organisms
EXAMPLE - Delta Vega
After the core of a Class F planet is sufficiently cool, volcanic activity lessens and the planet is considered Class G.
Oxygen and nitrogen are present in some abundance in the atmosphere, giving rise to increasingly complex organisms such as primitive vegetation like algae,
and animals similar to sponges and jellyfish.
As the surface cools, a Class G planet can evolve into a Class H, K, L, M, N, O, or P world.
<TEXTURE:09988230-c8ca-563d-9f59-6571f5964d24>
CLASS H - Desert
AGE - 4-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 8,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Hot zone/Ecosphere/Cold zone
SURFACE - Hot and acrid, little or no surface water
ATMOSPHERE - May contain heavy gases and metal vapors
LIFE FORMS - Drought- and radiation-resistant plants, animal life
EXAMPLES - Rigel XII, Tau Cygna V, Vulcan
A planet is considered Class H if less than 20% of its surface is water.
Though many Class H worlds are covered in sand, it is not required to be considered a desert; it must, however, receive little in the way of precipitation.
Drought-resistant plants and animals are common on Class H worlds, and many are inhabited by humanoid populations.
Most Class H worlds are hot and arid, but conditions can vary greatly.
<TEXTURE:2075a1d8-553d-95d2-5978-f962d7b17f8b>
CLASS I - Ice Giant
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 140,000-10 million km
LOCATION - Cold zone
SURFACE - Tenuous, comprised of gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen compounds; radiates heat
ATMOSPHERE - Zones vary in temperature, pressure and composition; water vapor may be present
LIFE FORMS - Unknown
Example - Q'tahl
Also known as Uranian planets, these gaseous giants have vastly different compositions from other giant worlds;
the core is mostly rock and ice surrounded by a tenuous layers of methane, water, and ammonia.
Additionally, the magnetic field is sharply inclined to the axis of rotation.  Class I planets typically form on the fringe of a star system.
<TEXTURE:853dc543-891c-fb14-ab97-c0cbd025025e>
CLASS J - Gas Giant
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 50,000-140,000 km
LOCATION - Cold zone
SURFACE - Tenuous, comprised of gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen compounds; radiates some heat
ATMOSPHERE - Zones vary in temperature, pressure and composition
LIFE FORMS - Hydrocarbon-based (Jovian)
EXAMPLES - Jupiter, Saturn
Class J planets are massive spheres of liquid and gaseous hydrogen, with small cores of metallic hydrogen.
Their atmospheres are extremely turbulent, with wind speeds in the most severe storms reaching 600 kph.
Many Class J planets also possess impressive ring systems, composed primarily of rock, dust, and ice.
They form in the Cold Zone of a star system, though typically much closer than Class I worlds.
<TEXTURE:c9f80ee1-8e0d-f401-3aa7-a2922105861e>
CLASS K - Adaptable
AGE - 4-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 5,000-10,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - Barren, little or no surface water
ATMOSPHERE - Thin, mostly carbon dioxide
LIFE FORMS - Primitive single celled organisms; adaptable for humanoid colonization through the use of pressure domes
EXAMPLES - Mars, Mudd
Though similar in appearance to Class H worlds, Class K planets lack the robust atmosphere of their desert counterparts.
Though rare, primitive single-celled organisms have been known to exist, though more complex life never evolves.
Humanoid colonization is, however, possible through the use of pressure domes and in some cases, terraforming.
<TEXTURE:e5071813-0c28-122e-b38d-dd55254a6161>
CLASS L - Marginal
AGE - 4-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - Rocky and barren, little surface water
ATMOSPHERE - Oxygen/argon, high concentration of carbon dioxide
LIFE FORMS - Limited plant life; suitable for humanoid colonization
EXAMPLE - Indri VIII
Class L planets are typically rocky, forested worlds devoid of animal life.
They are, however, well-suited for humanoid colonization and are prime candidates for terraforming.
Water is typically scarce, and if less than 20% of the surface is covered in water, the planet is considered Class H.
<TEXTURE:fc45a472-fa82-d273-614b-248b31a2339e>
CLASS M - Terrestrial
AGE - 3-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - Surface water abundant; if water or ice covers more than 80% of surface, planet is considered Class O or Class P
ATMOSPHERE - Nitrogen, oxygen, trace elements
LIFE FORMS - Extensive vegetation, animal life, humanoids
EXAMPLES: Earth, Risa, Bajor, Betazed
Class M planets are robust and varied worlds composed primarily of silicate rocks, and are highly suited for humanoid life.
To be considered Class M, between 20% and 80% of the surface must be covered in water;
it must have a breathable oxygen- nitrogen atmosphere and temperate climate.
<TEXTURE:46c1001f-dcce-2b57-134f-9ee473179613>
CLASS N - Reducing
AGE - 3-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - High surface temperature due to greenhouse effect; water exists only as vapor
ATMOSPHERE - Extremely dense, carbon dioxide and sulfides
LIFE FORMS - Unknown
EXAMPLE - Venus
Though frequently found in the Ecosphere, Class N planets are not conducive to life.
The terrain is barren, with surface temperatures in excess of 500° and an atmospheric pressure more than 90 times that of a Class-M world.
Additionally, the atmosphere is very dense and
composed of carbon dioxide; water exists only in the form of thick, vaporous clouds that shroud most of the planet.
<TEXTURE:9d5c7aab-db21-8471-bf47-7d7a8059da8b>
CLASS O - Pelagic
AGE - 3-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - Liquid water covers 80% or more of surface area
ATMOSPHERE - Nitrogen, oxygen, trace elements
LIFE FORMS - Aquatic vegetation, animal life, humanoids
EXAMPLE - Azati Prime, Ka'Tula Prime, Zirat
Any planet with more than 80% of the surface covered in water is considered Class O.
These worlds are usually very warm and possess vast cetacean populations in addition to tropical vegetation and animal life.
Though rare, humanoid populations have also formed on Class O planets.
<TEXTURE:9ab0f2b0-46ee-b116-7eb9-b0e3747e9aca>
CLASS P - Glaciated
AGE - 3-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Ecosphere
SURFACE - Water ice covers 80% or more of surface area
ATMOSPHERE - Nitrogen, oxygen, trace elements
LIFE FORMS - Hardy vegetation, animal life, humanoids
EXAMPLE - Andoria, Exo III, Rebena Te Ra, Rura Penthe
Any planet whose surface is more than 80% frozen is considered Class P.
These glaciated worlds are typically very cold, with temperatures rarely exceeding the freezing point.
Though not prime conditions for life, hearty plants and animals are not uncommon,
and some species, such as the Aenar and the Andorians, have evolved on Class P worlds.
<TEXTURE:cc74c835-c6be-3f84-599c-731fc38b4edc>
CLASS Q - Variable
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 4,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Hot zone/Ecosphere/Cold zone
SURFACE - Ranges from molten to water and/or carbon dioxide ice, due to eccentric orbit or variable output of star
ATMOSPHERE - Ranges from tenuous to very dense
EXAMPLE - Genesis Planet
These rare planetoids typically develop with a highly eccentric orbit, or near stars with a variable output.
As such, conditions on the planet's surface are widely varied.
Deserts and rainforests exist within a few kilometers of each other, while glaciers can simultaneously lie very near the equator.
Given the constant instability, is virtually impossible for life to exist on Class-Q worlds.
<TEXTURE:06c08642-56f2-9686-8a04-3ae6f71475c3>
CLASS R - Rogue
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 4,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Interstellar space, cometary halos
SURFACE - May be temperate due to geothermal venting
ATMOSPHERE - Primarily volcanic outgassing
LIFE FORMS - Non-photosynthetic plants, animal life
EXAMPLE - Dakala, Veneihm, Founders' Homeworld (prior to              	2371)
A Class R planet usually forms within a star system, but at some point in its evolution, the planet is expelled, likely the result of a catastrophic asteroid impact.
The shift radically changes the planet's evolution; many planets merely die,
but geologically active planets can sustain a habitable surface via volcanic outgassing and geothermal venting.
<TEXTURE:2320d472-87e4-117f-b217-aefa63190adc>
CLASSES S-Gas Supergiant and T - Gas Ultragiant
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 10-50 million km (Class S),
50-120 million km (Class T)
LOCATION - Cold zone
SURFACE - Tenuous, composed of gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen compounds; radiates considerable heat
ATMOSPHERE - Zones vary in temperature, pressure and composition; water vapor may be present
LIFE FORMS - Unknown
Example - Diadem, Tethe-Alla V
Aside from their immense size, Class S planets are very similar to their Class J counterparts,
with liquid metallic hydrogen cores surrounded by a hydrogen and helium atmosphere.
Class T planets represent the upper limits of planetary masses.
Most exist within a star system's Cold Zone and are very similar to Class S and J planets.
However, Class T planets occasionally form within a star system's Hot Zone.
If they are sufficiently massive (13 times more massive than Jupiter),
deuterium ignites nuclear fusion within the core, and the planet becomes a red dwarf star, creating a binary star system.
<TEXTURE:89d2b4ce-8b53-fc74-c55f-893c9ef3af3e
CLASS X - Chthonian,
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 1,000-10,000 km (Class X), 10,000-15,000 km (Class Y)
LOCATION - Hot zone
SURFACE - Temperature can exceed 500 Degrees Kelvin
ATMOSPHERE - Turbulent. Saturated with toxic chemicals and thermionic radiation
LIFE FORMS - None
Examples - Osirus, Mimetic (Delta Quadrant)
Class X planets are the result of a failed Class S, U planet in a star system's Hot Zone.
Instead of becoming a gas giant or red dwarf star,
a Class X planet was stripped of its hydrogen/ helium atmosphere.
The result is a small, barren world similar to a Class B planet, but with no atmosphere and an extremely dense, metal-rich core.
<TEXTURE:0e3c71f8-b4cf-a6a1-a25c-7dfb9fd7d81a>
CLASS Y - Demon
AGE - 2-10 billion years
DIAMETER - 10,000-15,000 km
LOCATION - Hot zone
SURFACE - Temperature can exceed 500 Degrees Kelvin
ATMOSPHERE - Turbulent. Saturated with toxic chemicals and thermionic radiation
LIFE FORMS - None
Perhaps the most environmentally unfriendly planets in the galaxy,
Class Y planets are toxic to life in every way imaginable.
The atmosphere is saturated with toxic radiation, temperatures are extreme, and atmospheric storms are amongst the most severe in the galaxy,
with winds in excess of 500 kph. Simply entering orbit is a dangerous prospect.
No known environment is less hospitable to humanoid life than a Class Y planetary body.
CLASS X and Z
Reserved for other designations of "demon" planets.
