Welcome to the Security Division in SDQ!
Our class today is SEC-202 / Federation Charter
*Takes a deep breath and proceeds*
<TEXTURE:a257698d-2501-bf21-03a6-023880dfcc70>
The Charter of the United Federation of Planets (or Federation Charter for short)
was the document that was ratified by the original members of the United Federation of Planets at that organization's founding in 2161.
Jonathan Archer was one of the signers of the charter.
The basis of the charter was the same as that of the one used by all the nations of earth during the founding of the United Nations back in the 20th century on earth after World War II.
The preamble announces the determination of member nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of intergalactic war;
reaffirm faith in the fundamental lifeform rights;
establish conditions under which justice and mutual respect of law is maintained;
promote social progress;
practice benevolent tolerance and live together in peace;
united to maintain peace and security;
only use armed forces for common defense;
and employment of galactic machinery for economic and social advancement.
There are 110 Articles of the current charter.
I will not go over all 110 Articles in this class, but we will go over a few of the key ones.
The current charter was signed on the planet Babel on 11 October 2161.
It is the highest law of the Federation and is included as Part 5 of the UFGQ Manual for Martial Law
We, the intelligent lifeforms of the United Federation of Planets,
determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of intergalactic war which has brought untold horror and suffering to our planetary social systems,
and to reaffirm faith in the fundamental intelligent lifeform rights, in the dignity and worth of the intelligent lifeform person,
to the equal rights of male and female and of planetary social systems large and small,
and to establish conditions under which justice and mutual respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of interplanetary law can be maintained,
and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
And to these ends to practice benevolent tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors, and to unite our strength to maintain intergalactic peace and security,
and to ensure by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods that armed force shall not be used except in the common defense,
And to employ intergalactic machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all intelligent lifeforms,
Have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims.
Accordingly, the respective social systems, through representatives assembled on the planet Babel, who have exhibited their full powers to be in good and due form,
have agreed to the present Charter, and do hereby establish an interplanetary organization to be known as
the United Federation of Planets.

Chapter I: Purposes and Principles
Article 1
The purposes of the United Federation of Planets are:
To maintain interplanetary peace and security within its acknowledged and accepted borders, and to that end:
to take effective collective measures for the prevention of threats to the peace,
the suppression of acts of aggression,
and to bring about by peaceful means,
and employing the principles of justice and intergalactic law,
adjustment or settlement of interplanetary disputes which might lead to a breach of the peace;
To develop friendly relations among planets based on respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination of intelligent lifeforms,
and to other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
To achieve interplanetary cooperation in solving intergalactic problems of economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character;
in promoting and encouraging respect for intelligent lifeform rights; and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to culture, sex, life form, or religious belief;
and To be a center for conciliation of the actions of all social systems in the attainment of these common ends.
Article 2
The Federation and its members, in pursuit of the purposes stated, shall act in accordance with the following principles:
The Federation is based on the sovereign equality of all its members;
In order to ensure to all of them equal rights and benefits resulting from membership,
all members shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter;
All members shall settle their interplanetary disputes by peaceful means in such manner that intergalactic peace, security, and justice, are not endangered;
In all interplanetary relations, all members shall refrain from the threat, or use, of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any planetary social system,
or in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Federation;
All members shall give the United Federation every assistance in any action taken in accordance with the present Charter,
and shall refrain from assisting any planetary social system against which the Federation is taking preventive or enforcement action;
The United Federation shall ensure that planetary social systems which are not members of the Federation act in accordance with these principles as necessary
for the maintenance of intergalactic peace and security;
Nothing within the present Charter shall authorize the Federation to intervene in matters which are essentially the domestic jurisdiction of any planetary social system,
