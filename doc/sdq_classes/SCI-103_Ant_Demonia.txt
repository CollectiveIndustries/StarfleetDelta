Welcome to the Medical/Science Division in SDQ!
Our class today is MSI-204 / History of the Science Division
*Takes a deep breath and proceeds*
<TEXTURE:619fb656-bc68-ae86-ab94-b94cdcacb1ee>
During this class we will look at the History of the Science Division.
We will first look at the history of the division and then a look at a few notable federation scientists.
The Science Division is a corps of officers who specialize in both scientific and medical research as well as control functions on aboard starbases, starships within Starfleet.
The Science Division was founded in the early 2120â€™s along with the rest of Starfleet.
Which at that time was the primary space defense and exploration organization of United who reported to the United Earth Space Probe Agency (UESPA).
Which itself was under the jurisdiction of the Command Council located on Earth.
<TEXTURE:6aea46ec-0e0e-4f1e-b109-fe51b1475cd6>
The Science Division included specializations such as sensors, research, theoretical and physical laboratory work, biological studies, medicine and surgery and also as technicians. 
Between 2140 and 2160, a Science Officer was distinguishable from other Officers by the blue division stripes worn on their uniforms.
With its foundation in 2161, the majority of Starfleet, including the Science Division, fell under the jurisdiction of the United Federation of Planets.
<TEXTURE:b0f5e32c-9b93-0207-673d-9ee8948ad30>
Along with the transfer, the uniform of a Science Officer changed, with the color blue continuing to be a constant throughout the many variations in Starfleet Uniforms.
By 2245, Science Officers, both medical and scientific alike, wore a blue tunic with black trousers.
<TEXTURE:0c4801a2-32be-7a5d-ada8-ead2637746c6>
In 2273 the Science Division separated into two individual divisions, Starfleet Medical and Starfleet Science.
Science Officers were noted by the orange color of their uniform bands, epaulets and accessories whereas Medical Officers wore green.
In 2280 the division split remained with the Science Officers wearing grey and the Medical Officers remaining in green.
<TEXTURE:3a7c8196-2de9-f4ff-b1e3-8e4fc5d4335b>
However in 2310, Starfleet decided to merge Starfleet Medical and Starfleet Science, with both parties wearing blue uniforms once again.
The blue was later replaced with a teal green color in 2353.
The Medical/Science Division remained intact until 2360 where it once again split into Starfleet Medical and Starfleet Science.
Starfleet Science continued to wear teal as its division color, Starfleet Medical returned to its original blue division color.
According to information obtained from the USS Voyager in 2377,
it is understood that Starfleet Medical and Starfleet Science will once again merge sometime during the 29th Century.
If they are the same division or not, Science and Medical continue to work closely together.
Depending on the size of the ship you are assigned to Medical and Sciences may have the same division head.
A smaller ship or base may combine the divisions.
WEARING OF NON DIVISIONAL COLORS
It is common practice for members of the Science Division to wear the color of the Science Division,
although it has been known for Science Officers to wear the colors of other divisions.
For example if a Science Officer was to become a Department Head, they may wear the colors of the Command Division.
Science is one of the main fundamental aspect of starfleet.
This can been seen by looking at the various scientific vessels that have served starfleet over the years such as
<TEXTURE:3defb429-0b85-0c6e-9883-fe017127168e>
the Miranda Class,
Miranda-class starships were a type of light cruiser introduced by Starfleet in the late 23rd century and remained in use through to the late 24th century.
The mission profile of the Miranda-class varied from performing various scientific roles to conducting patrol duties.
<TEXTURE:a59aab22-e550-f1ee-8183-9a30104d2371>
Oberth Class
The Oberth-class was a mid-sized Federation starship in service during the 23rd and 24th centuries.
It was used primarily by Starfleet and civilian scientists alike, as a scout and science vessel.
<TEXTURE:8f460aa9-d8eb-6988-c646-dc9b56f79c15>
and the Nova Class.
The class was designed for use as a science and scout vessel to replace the older Oberth Class.
Ships of the type were commonly assigned to planetary research and analysis missions.
<TEXTURE:9a7bde33-b31e-c5ae-0b34-c4978c65afa0>
Also throughout the Federation's history, major scientific breakthroughs are recorded beginning with Zefram Cochrane's first warp flight aboard the Phoenix.
<TEXTURE:4dda2946-6231-6d38-6743-045dcf4201a6>
On April 5th 2063, the first warp flight of the Phoenix attracted the attention of a passing Vulcan ship, the T'Plana-Hath, resulting in Earth's first contact with an alien race.
Modern Vulcan philosophy revolves around the concept of logic.
The highest objective of a traditional Vulcan life is to either control or suppress all emotion, thus rendering a purely logical being.
This difficult task is attained through meditation and discipline.
As Vulcans approach or reach maturity, it is customary to train under the tutelage of a Vulcan master in the Kolinahr ritual,
to purge themselves of any remaining lack of emotional control.
<TEXTURE:dab9fa68-5413-0ac4-4760-c6ae0187b059>
The father of Vulcan philosophy is Surak,
who helped lead the Vulcan people out of a time of savagery and violence into their new era of peace.
His introduction of logic and emotional discipline ushered in the Time of Awakening
<TEXTURE:2132a883-970e-428e-e969-21a27522ebc1>
In 2285 David Marcus,
son of the legendary Captain James T Kirk, created Project Genesis.
A scientific research project whose goal was to develop a process whereby uninhabitable planets could be made suitable for humanoid life.
This process involved reducing the target planet to subatomic particles, then reassembling them according to a pre-programmed matrix.
The project, spearheaded by Dr. Carol Marcus, was successfully tested inside a cavern on the Regula planetoid.
Khan Noonien Singh initiated a second test when he stole the Genesis Device and detonated it inside the Mutara Nebula, forming the Genesis Planet.
Despite the fact that initial tests had shown promise for the Genesis process, the planet created by Khan's actions proved to be unstable.
This was shown to be a function of the highly volatile protomatter that had been incorporated into the Genesis process.
Other notable Science Officers are:
<TEXTURE:dd2525a5-e35a-905b-f32b-64ee049d9926>
Jean-Luc Picard,
Captain of the USS Enterprise, the flagship of the federation, had an interest in Archaeology
<TEXTURE:1960f328-2b30-8bf2-1f9c-9b4e275e3ffa>
Kathryn Janeway,
Captain of the USS Voyager, was once the Chief Science Officer aboard the USS Al-Batani,
and most noted in history to be the first Captain to successfully traverse the Delta Quadrant.
Encountering dozens of new planets and civilizations over the course of seven years
<TEXTURE:bc7fe75f-9748-7d25-2ead-cd8295bf838b>
Seven of Nine,
a former Borg Drone, liberated from the collective by the crew of the USS Voyager in 2374.
Whilst serving aboard the ship, she constructed the USS Voyager's astrometrics lab,
which used Borg technology to plot routes that trimmed several years off of Voyager's journey.
The lab became an important asset to Voyager.
Using the astrometrics lab, Seven discovered the Hirogen communications network, which allowed Voyager to temporarily receive messages from the Alpha Quadrant.
<TEXTURE:992131e8-d832-61aa-c77c-916ff4d5d26d>
And of course there is Ambassador Spock,
once the Chief Science Officer aboard the USS Enterprise and now a noted Ambassador for the Federation.
<TEXTURE:982e6a07-c2a8-a414-d040-ee30aee8a5b4>
The understanding of science helps us to develop and maintain the federation, to help us prepare for the unknown.
The Science Division also plays a vital role to all the other Divisions.
For Instance without science, Security would not have the weapon power nor the defensive technology we use today.
Such things as transporters, warp technology and replicators, which we take for granted today, would not be possible.
Also, without a basic understanding of certain aspects of science, the other divisions would not be able to function, even if that aspect of science does not directly related to their division.
This concludes our lecture for today.
