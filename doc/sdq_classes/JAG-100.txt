Welcome to the Introduction to the Judge Advocate General Course.


Starfleet Delta Quadrant or SDQ is government by the Federation Charter and the local charter.  Starfleet is further governed by the UCMJ.


The Starfleet Judge Advocate Genral (JAG) Branch is the branch charged with overseeing legal matters within Starfleet. 

A Judge Advocate within Starfleet is an officer that oversees legal matters concerning Starfleet personnel. Legal counsel within Starfleet report into the senior JAG or SFJAG


The Judge Advocate General of Starfleet is the flag rank officer who oversees the JAG corps, and is a member of Starfleet Command. 


During the 2260s, the JAG Office was part of Starfleet's Operations division. By the 2350s it had moved under the Command division.  

Currently in SDQ it is a part of the Security Division, reporting to the Commander, Starfleet.


Judge Advocates serve primarily as legal advisors to the command to which they are assigned. In this function, they can also serve as the personal legal advisor to their commander.

Their advice may cover a wide range of issues dealing with administrative law, government contracting, civilian and military personnel law, law of war and international relations, environmental law, etc.


Judge Advocates may serve as military judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, assistance officers. 

As military judges they tend to preside over court martials that include a jury of the accused peers; or the legal team member on a board of inquiry.
