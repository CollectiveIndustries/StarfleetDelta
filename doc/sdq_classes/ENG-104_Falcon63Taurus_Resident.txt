Welcome to the Engineering Division in SDQ!
Our class today is ENG-104 / Ships Named Federation Pre Fed.
*Takes a deep breath and proceeds*
<TEXTURE:6337cdfe-395f-409e-e52d-012354cb664d>
One of the most famous ship names in starfleet is Enterprise,
although some argue witch Enterprise is the most famous.
I have often been asked what was the first ship named Enterprise.
I have researched data banks and dug through old books to try to answer this question.
We acknowledge that other species may have also used the name Enterprise.
But we will be looking at Starfleet and Earth history for this class.
Between 1616 and 1979, there were 13 'HMS Enterprises", while between 1775 and 1999, there were 8 "USS Enterprises".
There have also been 10 NASA and Starfleet "Enterprises", 8 French "Enterprises", 1 Confederate "Enterprise", a few planes, blimps and balloon Enterprises,
and countless privately-owned "Enterprises".
As I researched the history of the name, I quickly realized that each of these ships had a fascinating history,
and that the missions and patrols carried out by each ship are a reflection of the state of international relations and maritime technology at that point in time.
We do not have the time to go over every Enterprise in history so I have tried to pick a few notable ones for you. I hope you will find this an interesting class.
The first known Enterprise was a British ship which was sent to find the new passage to the Orient in 1616.
She succeeded, but was destroyed in a hurricane near India. There is little other data on her.
The next one on record was a French vessel L'Entreprise but she was captured in May of 1705 by the British.
She served in the Mediterranean under command of J. Paul.  May 19, 1707, her new captain takes command, W. Davenport, and she saw action off of Leghorn, (Livorno) Italy.
She wrecked on October 12, 1707 off of Thornton.  Her date of construction is not known.

<TEXTURE:30008227-4579-fb78-c585-fee0f37221b1>
Then came the British HMS Enterprise from 1709-1749.  She was completed and launched on April 28, 1709.
From 1709-1712: patrolled the Virginia under command of Nicholas Smith.  In June of 1711 she was taken on an expedition up the St. Lawrence under Rear Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker.
From 1712-1718: Patrolled home waters from 1712 to 1718.  In 1718: undertook a major repair and refit.  From 1721-1724: Patrolled off of Virginia again.
In 1740 she was renamed the Liverpool, a hospital ship and in September 1745 she was decommissioned.
Specifications:
Length: 118 feet
Beam: 32 feet
Compliment: 190
Armament: 40 guns
Displacement: 531 tons
<TEXTURE:8e10192d-6128-cf53-4d1a-b17a6d6886c3>
The first ship with the name USS Enterprise (for a United States Ship) was a Schooner that sailed from 1799 to 1823.
She was known as "Lucky little Enterprise". Enterprise's first action came on 1 August 1801 when, just west of Malta,
she defeated the 14-gun Tripolitan corsair Tripoli, after a fierce but one-sided battle.
Unscathed, Enterprise sent the battered pirate into port since the schooner's orders prohibited taking prizes.
This battle is depicted in the TEXTURE you see.
During her voyages the ship was put in service during the Quasi-war with France.
Where she Captured 8 privateers and recovered 11 captured American ships.
This ship was overhauled and rebuilt several times,
effectively changing from a twelve gun schooner to a fourteen gun topsail schooner and eventually to a brig rigged ship. Sailing the Mediterranean Sea .
It also sailed the  Caribbean & Gulf of Mexico to combat pirates, smugglers, and slavers. Her crew captured 13 ships on this duty.
Sadly, on July 9, 1823 she ran aground and broke up on Little Curacao island in the West Indies.
No losses to the crew.
Specifications:
Length: 84" 7"
Beam: 22" 6"
Compliment: 70
Armament: Twelve 6 pound guns
Displacement: 135 tons
<TEXTURE:a982b37b-813b-eedd-b961-8504e093a15e>
Believe it or not the first “flying” Enterprise was in 1861 and was a Balloon.
During the American Civil War, there was a United States Balloon Corps, which used a balloon named Enterprise.
These balloons were used for long range reconnaissance of troop movements.
Apparently, the Union Army made some use of these balloons until the Balloon Corps was disbanded in August 1863.
One notable event was on June 17, 1861 where Thaddeus Lowe demonstrates Enterprise at the Columbia Armory in Washington DC.
The balloon ascends to 500 feet, and transmits a telegraph to President Abraham Lincoln.
From 1864 to 1886 the British HMS Enterprise was the first composite ironclad (wooden construction with iron armor).
While some have classified this ship as a "lightweight battleship", I tend to think of her as a modified sloop-of-war.
At 180 feet she was MUCH smaller than what later was classified as a battleship.
Not much else is known other than in November of 1886 it was sold for scrap and dismantled.

We are going to jump ahead several years now to 1936 and the Aircraft Carrier CV-6 USS Enterprise. Known as "The Big E".
She was the sixth aircraft carrier of the United States Navy and the seventh U.S. Navy ship to bear the name.
Launched in 1936, she was a ship of the Yorktown class, She participated in more major actions of the war against Japan than did any other US ship.
Enterprise earned 20 battle stars, the most for any U.S. warship in World War II.
Some have labeled her the most glorious and honored ship in the history of the United States Navy, rivaled only perhaps by the 18th century frigate USS Constitution.
On one trip to Europe, she was boarded by the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Albert Alexander,
who presented Enterprise with a British Admiralty Pennant, the most prestigious decoration of the Royal Navy.
Enterprise is the only ship outside the Royal Navy to have received this award in the more than 400 years since its creation.
Enterprise entered the New York Naval Shipyard on 18 January 1946 for deactivation, and was decommissioned on 17 February 1947.

<TEXTURE:bb6fc663-ac9e-094d-7f42-4ee86a10eb21>
Then, in 1961 came the Aircraft Carrier CVAN-65 USS Enterprise.  The world's first nuclear powered aircraft carrier. Like her predecessor, she was nicknamed "The Big E".
There were no other ships in her class.  She served in the Vietnam war along with several of the Persian Gulf wars.
We are unsure of how long this ship served, some records were lost during the Eugenics wars.  But we do know she served until the early to mid 21st century.
One incident of note happened in 1986 with a mysterious incident at Alameda. Soviet spy Pavel Chekov was captured by ship's marines near one of the reactors.
Although Chekov was injured in an escape attempt, he later managed to escape from the hospital, probably with KGB assistance.
The Soviet Union denied any knowledge of a Pavel Chekov, or of any KGB/GRU operations aboard the Enterprise.
We know of this incident, as when the fugitive James T. Kirk and crew went back in time to bring Humpback whales back to the future.

In 1976 came the Space Shuttle OV-101 (USA) Enterprise, the first Space Shuttle Orbiter.  It was originally to be named Constitution (in honor of the U.S. Bicentennial),
however, viewers of the a popular TV Science Fiction show started a write-in campaign urging the White House to rename the vehicle Enterprise.
The name of that television show is not listed in the data bases.
While OV-101 never made it into space, she was a valuable testbed for the space shuttle program.
Originally, Enterprise had been intended to be refitted for orbital flight, which would have made it the second space shuttle to fly after Columbia.
However, during the construction of Columbia, details of the final design changed, particularly with regard to the weight of the fuselage and wings.
Refitting Enterprise for spaceflight would have involved dismantling the orbiter and returning the sections to subcontractors across the country.
As this was an expensive proposition, it was determined to be less costly to build Challenger around a body frame (STA-099) that had been created as a test article.
Similarly, Enterprise was considered for refit to replace Challenger after the latter was destroyed, but Endeavor was built from structural spares instead.
Finally, on November 18, 1895, Enterprise was ferried to Washington D.C., where it became the property of the Smithsonian Institution, where it can be seen to this day.
Specifications:
Length: 122' 2"
Wing Span 78"
Height: 56' 6"
Inert Weight 165,000 LB

In early 2020 man returned to the moon and the first of the new generation of Altair moon landers was named Enterprise.
Unlike the previous trips to the moon that used one rocket for launch, NASA would launch two separate rockets.
One would carry the lander vehicle and the separate rocket and fuel for the trip to the moon.  Then a second rocket would launch the crew in the Orion command module.
Once in space the crew would dock with the lander for the trip to the moon.
The Orion Crew Module is designed to be reusable for up to ten flights, allowing NASA to construct a fleet of Orion crew modules.
This was the start of building outposts and eventually a permanent base on the surface of the moon, setting the stage for the journey to Mars.
<TEXTURE:6b5fbe6f-a06a-a491-d760-b4fcc7bddf97>
On May 2, 2034 the third ship launched to take man to explore and live on another planet and was also named Enterprise.
These ships were designed to not only take people to Mars, but to provide shelter on the surface as well.
Upon arriving into Mars' orbit, the ship would break into sections where one would be the manned lander and the other part would parachute down and become the living quarters.
When the mission was done, the lander would return to the main ship that was left in orbit for the return flight.
With each new mission more living quarters are left for the next set of explores building a colony.
Unfortunately due the nuclear conflict in the 2050's much of the data from this time has been lost.

The next Enterprise we are able to find in the data base was a J-Class freighter built in 2090.
The J-class was a starship design of Earth origin which was utilized as a freighter.
They were capable of maintaining a maximum speed of warp two, and capable of hauling loads of up to 30,000 metric tons.
The warp reactors were personally designed by Zefram Cochrane himself, and there were rumors that he personally signed the inside of each reactor casing.
The inertial dampers aboard the J-class were far less advanced than that of later warp-capable vessels.
As such, all passengers on a J-class freighter would have to hold on to handles when the ship went to warp, or risk losing their balance.
Due to the long travel times between stops being 6 months to a year or more depending on the run, these freighters tended to be multi generational,
often handing down the captaincy from parent to child..

In 2122 came the USS Enterprise (XCV-330), also classified as the SS Enterprise.  It was the first spacecraft named Enterprise to be designated a starship.
The Enterprise was originally built as a simple Fusion probe on Earth in the early 22nd century.  It was one of the earliest vessels to leave the Sol system in the pre-warp era.
With warp drive ships starting to be built, she was taken out of active service sometime in the mid 2140's.
In 2175, the vessel was refitted and brought back into service as a historical passenger liner within the Federation.
For 47 years, the Enterprise offered large-scale transport between the major planets of the Federation.
Specifications:
Length: 984' 4"
Width: 820' 3" (outer rings)
Armaments: 1 plasma cannon
Capacity: 100 crew and 850 passengers
<TEXTURE:fb631ba6-c658-9766-5591-11dc15859aa3>
Then came the Enterprise NX-01, the Earth's first warp 5 capable starship.
Commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer, she was launched in 2151, heralding a new era defined by encountering numerous new species like the Andorians, and initiating those friendships.
The Enterprise established United Earth as a legitimate interstellar power and caused a wholesale revolution in Alpha and Beta Quadrant politics,
paving the way for the creation of the Coalition of Planets and eventually the United Federation of Planets in 2161.
In her first year the Enterprise crew made first contact with many species like Klingons, Andorians, Tellarites, just to name a few.
After the Xindi attack on Earth in March of 2153, Enterprise was recalled home.
Arriving on April 24th, Enterprise was refitted and upgraded with the new photonic torpedoes, enhanced hull plating, a universal translator update, a new command center,
and was relaunched on a new mission to the Delphic Expanse to search for the Xindi superweapon.
Enterprise also took on board a detachment of MACOs for this mission.  The search for the Xindi was long and perilous, taking almost a year.
Enterprise was in severe danger much of the time in the Expanse due to the presence of spatial anomalies.
After returning home the Enterprise went through a refit for repairs and upgrades to its systems and was relaunched in May of 2154.
Under the command of Archer the Enterprise served proudly until the Enterprise was retired in 2161 to make way for new, more advanced starships.
It was then placed in a Federation museum where it still remains.  If it was not for Captain Archer and this Enterprise. the Federation may very well have never formed.
Specifications:
Length: 738' 2"
Maximum speed: Warp 4.5 (cruising speed), 5.2 (emergency)
Armaments: Photonic torpedoes.
Phase cannons
Spatial torpedoes
This concludes our lecture for today.
