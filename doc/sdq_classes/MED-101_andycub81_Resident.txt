Welcome to the Medical/Science Division in SDQ!
Our class today is MSI-101 / History of Nursing.
*Takes a deep breath and proceeds*
Nursing is a healthcare profession focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain,
maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life from conception to death.
From the beginning, there have always been those who take great care in tending the wounded and bringing the ill back to health.
In fifth century BC, Earth, Hippocrates was one of the first people in the world to study health care, earning him the title of "the father of modern medicine".
Hence, the Hippocratic Oath, taken by all medical professionals in Starfleet.
The first instructional school for nurses on Earth was established in 1850 clearing the path for medical institutions all around the globe.
In relatively short time, the International Council of Nurses was formed in 1899 to oversee nursing education and practice.

Florence Nightingale, born in 1820, was perhaps the most famous nurse in history, She was a celebrated English nurse, writer and statistician.
Nightingale laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment, in 1860,
of her nursing school at St Thomas Hospital in London, the first secular nursing school on Earth.
The annual International Nurses Day is celebrated all over Earth on her birthday.

Notable nurses from the past also include Christine Chapel of the USS Enterprise served with distinction under Dr. Leonard McCoy from 2266 to the 2280s.
Chapel had abandoned a career in bio-research for a position in Starfleet,
in the hopes that a deep-space assignment would one day reunite her with her fianc√©,
Dr. Roger Korby, a scientist of renown, incommunicado from his expedition to Exo III since 2261.

Nurse Alyssa Ogawa was stationed on the USS Enterprise-D in 2367 and later, the USS Enterprise-E under Dr. Beverly Crusher.
Ogawa was present during several surgeries involving a Trill Ambassador, which was the first Federation observations of the Trill symbiont in 2367.

Starfleet Medical is a department of Starfleet dedicated to biological research and treatment of officers.
Based out of San Francisco on Earth, Starfleet Medical oversees all Starfleet medical personnel and facilities.
In the 23rd century, an office was established known as the Starfleet Surgeon General which held some command authority over Starfleet Medical,
including the power to relieve starship medical officers for incompetence.
Nurses work in many different areas independently and as part of a team to assess, plan and implement care.
They are important as they are the ones who are charged with carrying out the orders of the physician.
They are hands on and are usually the ones who are first to notice complications and begin interventions in such situations.
Nurses are educated to anticipate and meet the needs of the whole person rather than just the presenting health problem.
When doctors diagnose and treat the disease, it is nurses who take pre-and post-operative care of the patient.
Professional nurses do not blindly follow orders; they are critical thinker and problem solvers.
Nurses have many additional roles and play key roles in meeting the needs of patients, patient safety, medication safety,
communication and serving as part of the health care team. This role allows nurses to contribute to quality improvement in health care around the clock.
Nurse's up-to-date knowledge on disease and illness helps them to contribute on creating awareness about health practice, disease and prevention
Nurses in rehabilitation settings help patients adapt to their disabilities, achieve their greatest potential, and work toward productive lives.
Being able to function is to maintaining or regaining independence and quality of life, particularly after an illness or injury.
Nurses also have a key role in Health care Research, especially in the areas of primary care, outcomes research, translation of research into practice, and quality of care.
Nurses are uniquely qualified to blend communication, clinical, and administrative skills which are necessary to conduct clinical research.
As medical practitioners we are duty bound the help those suffering or in need.
This concludes our lecture for today.
